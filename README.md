Thanks for visiting my GitHub page, I a am Yugam, a resident Native of Rajasthan, India. I am a tech enthusiast and one time entrepreneur. 

I started my career as a Data Scientist at Embibe, which is India's leading AI powered Edtech startup, following this I went on to start my own venture in f&b space, owing to my interest in the category, 
one year down the line, have done over 1.2 million in sales fulfilling over 3000+ order, I faced some harsh realities about the foodtech play and cloud kitchen ecosystem, and realized that's not really
what I wanted, I winded up my operations and then worked with another growing foodtech player, EazyDiner for a while. I am excited and optimistic about what the future holds for me, living in the golden
decade in India, I look forward to some exciting times ahead
